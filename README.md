* `Dockerfile`: Contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

* `README.md`: Shows what content was added and tested in Mini Project 2.

* `requirements.txt`: Added the pandas package with specific version, which is 2.1.0.

* `githubactions`: Tested the code created using pandas to ensure that Git Actions runs properly.

* `main.py` and `test_main.py`: Created arbitrary data 'GDP_Data' and used pandas to create 'main.py' and 'test_main.py' to ensure that the code runs properly.
